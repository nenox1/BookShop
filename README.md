# BookShop
C++ program Book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop.
The list includes details such as title, author, publisher, price and stock value. Whenever a customer
wants a book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system serches the list and displays 
whether it is available or not. If it is, then the system displays the book details an request for the 
number of copies required. If the requested copies are available, the total cost of requested copies is displayed;
otherwise the message "Required copies not in stock" is displayed.
